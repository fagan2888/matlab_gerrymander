<p><b>Test of Effects: How many extra seats did either party gain relative to party-neutral sampling? (fantasy delegations)</b>: It is possible to estimate how the state's delegation would be composed if votes were distributed according to natural variations in districting. This is done by drawing districts at random from a large national sample, and then examining combinations whose vote totals are similar to the actual outcome. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In the following simulations, individual districts used to build "fantasy delegations" were flipped at random, thus generating a partisan-symmetric distribution. Consequently, these simulations ignore population clustering and show what would occur in a fully partisan-symmetric situation.</p>

<p>In this election, the average Democratic vote share across all districts was NaN%, and Democrats won 2 seats. 2 fantasy delegations with the same vote share had an average of 2.0 Democratic seats (green symbol), with a standard deviation of 0.0 seats (see error bar). The actual outcome (red symbol) was therefore advantageous toHowever, this advantage was not statistically significant. </p>
